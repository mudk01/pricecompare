# pricecompare by devsly

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This website application allows users to create a shopping list that displays the 
price of each product at different stores. It allows users to compare the grocery list 
total for each store in a side-by-side comparison.

This project utilizes Python for the backend for web scraping in order to obtain price
listings for each product. React Native is used for the frontend. Pyodide was used to 
integrate the front- and backend, allowing support for Python and JavaScript coding.
