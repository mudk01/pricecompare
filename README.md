# pricecompare by devsly

##PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This website application allows users to create a shopping list that displays the 
price of each product at different stores. It allows users to compare the list 
total for each store in a side-by-side comparison.

This project utilizes Python for the backend for web scraping in order to obtain price
listings for each product. React.js is used for the frontend. Flask was used to 
integrate the front- and backend.

##how to run project
From your terminal, navigate to the server folder and run python main.py to run the api.
Open a new terminal and navigate to the client folder and run npm start to run the front-end.
##how to use
Enter an item in the search bar. After the web scraping happens in the backend, the data is sent to the front-end via an api and logged in the web browser's console. The goal was to add multiple items to a list and compare the total price, however, we did not get that far.
